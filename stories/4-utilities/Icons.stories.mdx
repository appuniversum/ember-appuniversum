# Icons

Appuniversum includes many SVG icons that can be used by passing the name of the icon into the component, e.g.

```
<AuButton @icon="book">Button Text</AuButton>
```

Alternatively, wherever you can pass an icon name you can instead pass an Ember component that will be rendered instead of the default SVG in the AuIcon component.
This can be used, for example, to use inline SVGs or PNG icons.

Although the Ember component will not be passed any arguments, it's possible to pass them using the `component` helper.
See [AuIcon docs](/docs/components-brand-auicon--with-custom-icon) for a live example.

```
<AuButton @icon={{component 'custom-icon' iconName='some-name'}}>Button Text</AuButton>
```

All the available icons are listed here:

  <Story story={iconStories.Icons} />
