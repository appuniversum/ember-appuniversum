## Getting started

### Add the `<AuToaster />` component

To use the Appuniversum toaster service you first need to add the `<AuToaster />` component to your app. Usually at the bottom of the `application.hbs` file is a good place for this.

```handlebars
{{! application.hbs }}
<AuToaster />
```

### Display some toasts

```ts

import { service } from "@ember/service';

class SomeContainerAwareClass {
  @service toaster;

  displayToaster() {
    this.toaster.notify('toaster content', 'Hello toasters!');
  }
}
```

## `Toaster` service API

### `notify` / `success` / `warning` / `error` / `loading`

All these methods have the same API. The only difference is the default icon and type that is used.

```ts
interface ToastOptions {
  type?: "info" | "success" | "warning" | "error"; // Default depends on the used display method
  icon?: string; // Any valid Appuniversum icon name, default depends on the used display method
  timeOut?: number; // delay in milliseconds after which the toast auto-closes
  closable?: boolean; // Can the toast be closed by users, defaults to `true`
}

const toast = this.toaster.notify(message, title, options);
```

### `show`

The `show` method can be used to display custom toaster components. This allows for more flexibility in case the default display methods are missing some features.

Custom toaster components are regular components that you have full control over. Each component instance will receive an `@options` argument containing the options that were passed into the `show` method. This can be used to pass dynamic data to the custom component.
They will also receive a `@close` argument that can be used to close the toaster from inside the custom toaster class itself.


```ts
import CustomToaster from 'some-project/components/custom-toaster';

// ..
this.toaster.show(CustomToaster, options);
```

### `close`

This method can be used to close toasts manually from code. It accepts a toasts object as an argument (which is returned by one of the display methods).

```ts
this.toaster.close(toast);
```
