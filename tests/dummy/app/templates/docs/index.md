# Ember Appuniversum

This is an early proof of concept of a new CSS framework for Flanders GOV applications.

## The goal of this project is to:
- establish a shared set of coding guidelines and best practices
- create and maintain accessible and reusable components
- create and maintain a uniform but flexible identity suited for applications (a sibling to [Webuniversum](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/webuniversum/v3/))
- promote the coöperation between different teams working on Flanders GOV applications
